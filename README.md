# electronforge + react + typescript + bytenode

 
a big thanks to @spaceagetv for [this repo](https://github.com/spaceagetv/electron-bytenode-example.git) which makes it all possible.

this is a quick start for u that u can use electronforge with react

the main reason it has been created was a project of mind which requires loadUrl of a real website along multiple local pages.

back then it must be encrypted after being installed on client application which is one of the advantage of this quick start.

I am pretty sure u can understand it only by looking at package.json.

in the core it is almost the same as a fresh electron app generated by:
```
yarn create electron-app --template=typescript-webpack
```
